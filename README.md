## Next GdR App

Chat-based RPG app built with Next.js

### Stack:

- Next.js
- React
- Tailwind
- Hero UI
- Drizzle ORM

## Developers

### Installation

- Run `npm install`

### Guidelines

-

### TODO

- [ ] SWR for fetching data
- [ ] Zod for validation (should be configurable with drizzle)
- [ ] Configurable dictionary (consider just reading a json file at build time - less flexible but easier)
- [ ] More Auth options
- [ ] Roled-based access (admin, master, user)
